# RouterJS

RouterJS is a small, stand-alone javascript router that works very much like the Backbone router, but with a couple of advantages, mainly it's lightweight and doesn't rely on any frameworks or libraries such as Underscore.

As an added bonus if HistoryJS is found to be present, RouterJS will use the HistoryJS listeners and triggers.
